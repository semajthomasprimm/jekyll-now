                <h2>How I Built This Site</h2>
                <p>Setting up my portfolio site was pretty straightforward. I wanted to create a use a static site generator and Jekyll ended up fitting the bill.</p>
                <p>I bought semajThomas-Primm.com from GoDaddy and verified my ownership. Next, I forked the jekyll-now repository and renamed it to semajthomas.primm.github.io. I went into the settings for my new repository and changed the link from semajthomasprimm.github.io to semajThomas-Primm.com. </p>
                <p>Now that I had a functioning website, I had a default theme which was pretty bland. I decided to create my own theme, but I needed to install Jekyll locally to start.</p>
                <p>I'm currently running on a Windows 10 64-bit computer, so I headed over to <a href="http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com">this tutorial</a> to install Jekyll.</p>
                <p>Once I finished installing Jekyll, I edited my _config.yml file so I could properly view my site locally at http://0.0.0.1:4000/. I set baseurl: to "" and my url: to http://semajThomas-Primm.com.</p>
                <p>My website was working locally!</p>
                <p>To start my designing my website, I wanted a straightforward and stylistic theme that would show my capabilities to clients. I decided to use Bootstrap, because it's a responsive and easy-to-use framework.</p>
                <p>A simple Google search revealed that the most effective method of installing Bootstrap with Jekyll was to use Bootstrap-Sass. To save time, I used Bower quickly install bootstrap-sass and started developing immediately.</p>
