                <h2>How I Built This Site</h2>
                <p>Setting up my portfolio site was pretty straightforward. I wanted to use a static site generator and Jekyll ended up fitting the bill.</p>
                <p>I forked the jekyll-now repository and renamed it to semajthomasprimm.github.io. </p>
                <p>Now that I had a functioning website, I had a default theme which was pretty bland. I decided to create my own theme, but needed to install Jekyll locally to start.</p>
                <p>I'm currently running on a Windows 10 64-bit computer, so I headed over to <a href="http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com">this tutorial</a> to install Jekyll.</p>
                <p>Once I finished installing Jekyll, I edited my _config.yml file so I could properly view my site locally at http://0.0.0.1:4000/.</p>
                <p>My website was working locally!</p>
                <p>To start my designing my website, I wanted a straightforward and stylistic theme that would show my capabilities to clients. I decided to use Bootstrap, because it's a responsive and easy-to-use framework.</p>
                <p>A simple Google search revealed that the most effective method of installing Bootstrap with Jekyll was to use Bootstrap-Sass. To save time, I used Bower quickly install bootstrap-sass and started developing immediately.</p>
